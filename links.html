<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The artist formally known as Eros Carl Backus, was born on February 9th, 2001, in Lansing, Michigan as the town his family <br>
lived in at the time did not have a hospital (and still doesn’t). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The youngest of six, they grew up as a pastor's kid in rural Illinois spending most of their summers in northern Minnesota <br>
where his Nana taught them various fiber crafts and gardening skills. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Primarily a ceramic artist (or at least in his heart of hearts) Eros has worked in slip casted porcelain with what he has called <br>
“prop work”-molding mass produced objects to be broken as an act of catharsis or calculated failure.
These performances lean into <br>considering the complexity of queerness through domestic and industrialized materials/processes and antiquated hierarchical values. <br>
Their work draws from personal experiences and seemingly unable to leave an object by itself, he focuses on playing with materiality<br>
of items with humor that shows a proclivity for showmanship.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Eros especially will be remembered for his tendency towards the dramatic.
