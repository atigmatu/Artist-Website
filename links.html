<div id="artist">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The artist formally known as Eros C(arl) Backus is a
  craftsman of many trades- and hats for that matter.<br>
  Forever interested in the hierarchies of materials and their processes, he recreates and investigates mundane, everyday objects <br>
  to better understand and subsequently deconstruct the values they hold in society. <br>
&nbsp;  Never truly focused on exact mimicry, Eros continually plays with form and (non)function intertwined with traditional histories of mediums. <br>
  Much of his work centers around activation and performance that displays tangible humor and a proclivity for showmanship,<br>
  as he is seemingly unable to leave an object by itself. In his current series of works that he lovingly describes as 'prop work',<br>
  he demonstrates a great knowledge of timing and intention with the eye of a director.<br>
&nbsp; While there is a certain level of play in Eros' works there is a deeper remembering of nostalgia and memory at hand as well; <br>
  a calculated catharsis that he, as a performer and artist goes through, as does the viewer of his work. Tactility is extremely prevelant,<br>
  physically and emotionally, whether that is in weight, material, or memory.

Eros especially will be remembered for his tendency towards the dramatic.
